## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- CSS grid: make responsive layout
- React: component base UI

### Continued development

In my opinion using react base component can easier to make sure the HTML structure in WCAG and ARIA correct more easier

### Useful resources

- [Improve Responsiveness](https://utopia.fyi/) - This helped me for make responsiveness easier
